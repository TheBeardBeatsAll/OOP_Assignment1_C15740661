Hector Delgado,Major,Brick,Healthy,35,65,77,45,80,Shredder,Suppression,Holo Targeting,Hail of Bullets,Chain Shot,During the original war, the first mission XCOM attempted set the tone for the war. Of the four soldiers sent, only Hector came back, and as a broken man. Never cleared for combat before XCOM was canceled, Hector was not targeted by ADVENT until recently. This was a mistake, as he has actual formal training.
An Ho,Captain,Stalker,Healthy,24,70,75,88,55,Medical Protocol,Field Medic,Scanning Protocol,Covering Fire,N/A,China was one of the major contributors to the original XCOM project, which did not make their government particularly well liked by ADVENT. When the Chinese army was disbanded, some soldiers never reported in for disarmament. The continual losses of ADVENT patrol members in her home village was attributed to An accurately, until a full sweep and clear forced her into fleeing.
Emmanuelle Bernard,Colonel,Socks,Severly Wounded,44,75,62,72,88,Run and Gun,Shadowstrike,Untouchable,Rapid Fire,Implacable,France's police forces SWAT operated after the ADVENT governmental change. But one can only hunt down people you are sympathetic to for so long. Fleeing her home country and a duty she no longer believes in, she escaped in a crate of socks and has never lived it down.
Erica Hall,Captain,Mad Dog,Healthy,30,78,82,68,83,Blademaster,Phantom,Shadowstep,Bladestorm,N/A,Canada was hardly damaged in the invasion, though its tiny military was disproportionately harmed. The final class of military cadets never officially graduated when the nation was 're-bordered' by ADVENT. The prospect of staying in the now ADVENT military and being stationed far from home didn't appeal to Erica. Unfortunately ADVENT wasn't asking for membership, forcing her on the run.
Annette Durand,Lieutenant,Smokes,Wounded,27,87,73,40,77,Long Watch,Deadeye,Death From Above,N/A,N/A,Some people want to fight ADVENT, others don't have a choise. Annette is one of the latter and has never understood why. After years of running, she is tired of fleeing and ready to fight. XCOM is the symbol that draws people like her into the fight.
Kari Johnson,Sergeant,Nix,Healthy,58,81,64,80,76,Field Medic,Run and Gun,Quickdraw,N/A,N/A,Sweden has been the center of an 'anti-terrorist' campaign for the last three years, trying to track down and ferret out the cell of resistance there which caught our attention. The truth is there is no cell, just Kari and lots of careful prep work before an attack.
Alica Ravenshaw,Sergeant,Deadbolt,Healthy,21,68,64,77,80,Blast Padding,Covering Fire,Untouchable,N/A,N/A,XCOM had vetted many soldiers for recruitment to replace losses before it was shut down, including members of PMCs. PMC's that were co-opted or hunted to extinction during ADVENT's seizure of power. The records from XCOM's recruitment intentions included Sorain, Alica's mother. When she learned that was why the resistance contacted her, she jumped at the chance to take her place. Seeing your mother bleed out in-front of you at the age of ten tends to motivate a person.
Michael Taylor,Sergeant,Breach,Healthy,12,80,55,94,77,Haywire Protocol,Threat Assessment,Ever Vigilant,N/A,N/A,Few know about Taylor's role in one of the biggest digital heists in history from before ADVENT's rise to power. For one, he's not talking.What we do know, however, is that Michael offered his services as a 'computer tech' soon after the aliens seized control.His Gremlin stuffed with 'personalised' files and hardware, few ADVENT firewalls can resist his intrusions.
Donovan Carter,Colonel,Hazmat,Healthy,67,64,68,77,84,Blast Padding,Demolition,Heavy Ordnance,Volatile Mix,Saturation Fire,Squadmates had only one word in mind when they saw Donovan in his personal combat gear for the first time: ' Hazmat '. He decided to live up to it and dress the part completely.Carter was born in the UK, but migrated to the US at an early age. There he enlisted and trained in heavy weapons and explosives. That is, until ADVENT took over and discharged him (for disobeying orders).Now he discharges -them-.
Denise Laroque,Sergeant,Nuit,Severly Wounded,41,71,62,65,77,Lightning Hands,Suppression,Deep Cover,N/A,N/A,At first her life in France was easy thanks to ADVENT. As fate would have it, she overheard a resistance conversation in a local bar. Intrigued, she tracked one of them quietly and found the local resistance cell. Everything after is, as they say, 'histoire ancienne'.An ex-member of GIGN, Denise is an excellent addition to any team looking to infiltrate enemy positions.
Julien D'Angelo,Lieutenant,Stalker,Injured,26,64,63,65,89,Soulfire,Inspire,Schism,N/A,N/A,Julien was forwarded by French resistance forces. One of his superiors told our contact that he was a 'special case'. However, we haven't found anything that makes him outstanding in any way. In fact, his shooting skills are average at best. *BRADFORD NOTE* I'm getting reports of unexplainable 'mishaps' wherever this guy goes. Call it a hunch, but send him to the Psi Lab as soon as it's constructed.
Valeriya Badvornova,Lieutenant,Yeti,Healthy,61,84,73,53,64,Blademaster,Bladestorm,Quickdraw,Faceoff,N/A,Not much is known about Valeriya, other than that Russian resistance forces urged us to take her in. Or was that 'get her off their hands' ?Rumor has it she collects trophies from fallen enemies. After several locker inspections which turned up nothing, Central has decided to let this matter rest.
Chris MacPryde,Captain,God,Wounded,78,40,94,64,88,Kill Zone,Serial,Steady Hands,Death From Above,N/A,When a meeting between XCOM operatives and local resistance leaders came under fire by ADVENT, help came from an unexpected source.An unknown sniper had perched up high in a local church tower, and managed to take out at least half of the enemy forces. After the fight was over, they only found a single note:' light a flare if you want me to join XCOM'. *BRADFORD NOTE* Gave the only guy carrying a flare free drinks at the bar for a week.
Anthony Maxwell,Sergeant,Iron Man,Healthy,35,75,68,44,79,Reaper,Rupture,Saturation Fire,N/A,N/A,An ADVENT raid left Anthony the sole survivor of his small town. Found buried but alive under iron debris, resistance forces freed him and took him in. Despite being playfully mocked for his peculiar sense of humor, Maxwell decided to hone his skills as a medical specialist. He soon found his services (and humor) in demand by squadmates heading out on an op.
