My program creates a PDA for the Commander of XCOM based on XCOM 2
It loads in data from a number of csv files to be used as well as 
wav sound files and png/jpg image files.
The user can turn the PDA on/off by clicking with the mouse the power button or by hitting the space key
After the loading screen the user can navigate using mouse clicks on any of the buttons or by
using the 'w' & 's' key to go up or down on the main menu, 'q' & 'a' key on the mission menu,
'e' & 'd' on the soldier menu or with the enter key to select/deselect the mission and/or soliders.

The parts of this I am proudest off are the mission and soldier screens and how they are selected.
